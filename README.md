## Problem Statement
The journey through my undergraduate studies was marked by persistent challenge that deeply impacted not just my own learnings, but that of my peers and fellow students. We often stuck, when dealing with bugs, figuring out coding problems, or sometimes not even know where to start or which resources to follow. This resulted in a significant amount of time being spent unnecessarily, as tasks that could have been completed in a day often took three to four days to figure out. The lack of guidance, not knowing about opportunities, and the sense of isolation further compounded these difficulties. Additionaly, introvert students due to their lack of audacity to speak up, often refrain from asking their doubts.

## Solution
It's crucial to address this issue, as I have closely witnessed the struggles among peers. The challenges students face,can deter them from continuing their learning efforts.While there are many startups offers courses, but the importance of community support in overcoming these challanges is often overlooked. 
So I embarked on a mission to bridge the gap between aspiration and achievement. The result was 'Doubtless' not merely an application, but a lifeline for learners. 

It is designed to make learning easier by connecting learners with experienced individuals where users can join groups based on what they want to learn and ask their questions. It covers different tech domains, so everyone can find something that interests them. This app helps  in speed up problem-solving, turning days of troubleshooting into just few hours.
