## Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, technology is constantly evolving, and staying up to date with new technologies has become increasingly important. Learning new technologies can be a challenging task, especially for beginners, who often encounter errors and difficulties that they are unable to resolve on their own. As a result, individuals may end up spending a lot of time searching for solutions on various websites and watching countless YouTube videos and end up with frustration.
There are a lot of startups focussing on solving the current education system problems by providing free/low costs courses, but not many realize what difference a community can make.

## Solution
To address this problem, this project aims to provide a platform where users can seek help with their doubts and queries related to various technologies.
Doubtless provides a platform for users to join groups, where they can interact with other learners and experts in the field, share their queries and collaborate with others to enhance their learning experience.
