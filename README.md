## Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, technology is constantly evolving, and staying up to date with new technologies has become increasingly important. Learning new technologies can be challenging, especially for beginners who face errors and difficulties they can't solve on their own. This often leads to frustration as individuals spend a lot of time searching for solutions online. This can result in some learners giving up on their learning journey. While many startups offer low-cost courses, the importance of community support in overcoming these challenges is often overlooked.

## Solution
To address this, our project Doubtless provides a platform where users can seek help with their tech-related queries. By joining groups, users can interact with fellow learners and experts, sharing their questions and collaborating to enhance their learning experience. This fosters a supportive community environment where users can swiftly resolve issues and accelerate their learning journey.

This speeds up issue resolution, turning days of troubleshooting into just hours and makes learning smoother and more efficient for users especially beginners who are in their learning phase. We also offer a chatbot feature for instant assistance for app-related queries.
